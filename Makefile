# C++, because every test in this project is C++ and a header that forgets
# `extern "C"` links against nothing.
#
# The list is every header `install` copies, which is not the same as every
# header under include/.  It globbed include/ alone and so checked 25 of the
# 26 headers that ship: libver_gen.h is generated into $(GEN_DIR) and installed
# from there, so the one header whose content is produced by the build rather

# Flag stamps
####################################################################
# Each build tree carries the flag string it was built with. The stamp is
# rewritten only when that string differs -- written to a scratch file,
# compared, moved into place only on a difference -- so its mtime moves on a
# flag change and on nothing else. The object rules above depend on it.
#
# This replaces listing `Makefile` as a prerequisite, which was too broad (a
# comment-only edit recompiled everything) and too narrow (a command-line
# override such as `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-O2` changes no file's mtime and so was
# invisible).
#
# These rules sit at the end of the file for two reasons. A rule's target
# expands when make reads the line, so a stamp rule above its own OBJ_DIR
# definition has an empty target: not an error, just a rule that silently does
# not exist. And the first target in a makefile is the default goal, so a stamp
# rule above `all:` makes a bare `make` build the stamp and nothing else.
