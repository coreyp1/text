# YAML Module - Current Limitations and Status

**Last Updated:** February 14, 2026  
**Current Version:** Alpha (In Active Development)

This document provides an honest assessment of the YAML module's current implementation status, known limitations, and planned improvements.

---

## Executive Summary

### ✅ What's Working

The YAML module has a **functional streaming parser** with:
- Event-driven parsing with callbacks
- UTF-8 validation
- Anchor/alias resolution with cycle detection
- Document markers (`---`, `...`) with proper event emission
- Multi-document stream support
- All scalar styles (plain, quoted, literal, folded)
- All escape sequences including Unicode
- `%YAML` and `%TAG` directives with tag handle resolution
- Schema-based implicit typing (Failsafe, JSON, Core)
- Security limits (depth, bytes, alias expansion)
- Memory safety (889+ tests pass valgrind with zero leaks)
- Comprehensive test coverage (889 tests passing - 100% pass rate)
- DOM parsing with accessors, mutation, and cloning
- Writer/serializer for DOM and streaming events
- YAML 1.1 compatibility mode (directive or parse option)

### ⏳ What's Planned

The following features are **designed but partially implemented**:
- Full YAML 1.2 spec compliance - Phase 7
- Pull-model streaming parser - Phase 7 (optional)
- Binary scalar support (Phase 7)

### ⚠️ Known Issues

See [Known Bugs](#known-bugs) section below for specific issues.

## Implementation Status by Feature

### ✅ Fully Implemented

#### Streaming Parser (Phase 3)
- ✅ Event-based parsing with callbacks
- ✅ Chunked input handling (arbitrary boundaries)
- ✅ Basic indicators (`:`, `-`, `?`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `#`, `&`, `*`)
- ✅ Plain scalars (unquoted strings) with context-aware parsing
- ✅ Single-quoted scalars with escape support
- ✅ Double-quoted scalars with all escape sequences
- ✅ Literal scalars (`|`) with chomping indicators
- ✅ Folded scalars (`>`) with line folding
- ✅ All escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`, `\"`, `\'`, `\0`, `\a`, `\b`, `\f`, `\v`, `\e`)

- ✅ Block-style collections (sequences and mappings)
- ✅ Flow-style collections

#### UTF-8 Support (Phase 2)
- ✅ UTF-8 validation
- ✅ 1-4 byte UTF-8 sequences
- ✅ Invalid sequence detection (truncated, overlong, lone continuation bytes)

#### Anchor/Alias Resolution (Phase 5 - Partial)
- ✅ Anchor registration (`&name`)
- ✅ Alias references (`*name`)
- ✅ Cycle detection (prevents infinite loops)
- ✅ Expansion size computation (DFS-based)
- ✅ Alias expansion limits (prevents decompression bombs)

#### Security (Phase 9 - Quality)
- ✅ Depth limit enforcement
- ✅ Total bytes limit enforcement
- ✅ Alias expansion limit enforcement
- ✅ Memory safety (zero leaks verified)
- ✅ Use-after-free bugs fixed

#### Testing (Phase 9)
- ✅ 889 comprehensive tests (100% pass rate)
- ✅ All tests pass valgrind with zero leaks
- ✅ All tests pass AddressSanitizer
- ✅ Nested structures, all scalar styles, UTF-8, error conditions
- ✅ Real-world YAML files (Docker, K8s, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- ✅ Block and flow collections
- ✅ Escape sequences and Unicode support
- ✅ Multi-document streams

### 🚧 Partially Implemented

#### DOM Builder (Phase 4)
- ✅ Arena-based node allocation (Task 4.1 complete)
- ✅ `gtext_yaml_parse()` one-shot parser (Task 4.2 complete)
- ✅ Node type system (null/bool/int/float/string/sequence/mapping)
- ✅ DOM inspection API (Task 4.3 complete)
- ✅ Anchor/alias resolution in DOM (Task 4.4 complete)
- ✅ Block-style collection support (Task 4.6 complete)
- ⚠️ Multi-document support (Task 4.5 ready to start - was blocked, now unblocked)
- ❌ DOM manipulation API (Task 4.7 not started)
- ❌ Node cloning (Task 4.8 not started)

**Status:** Phase 4 is ~62.5% complete (5/8 tasks). Basic DOM parsing works for single documents.

**Limitations:**
- Multi-document DOM parsing ready but not yet implemented
- Cannot programmatically build/modify DOM (add/remove/modify nodes)
- No deep copy functionality for nodes

#### Scalar Styles (Phase 3.3 - Complete)
- ✅ Plain scalars (unquoted) with context-aware parsing
- ✅ Single-quoted scalars (complete with escape sequences)
- ✅ Double-quoted scalars (complete with all escape sequences)
- ✅ Literal scalars (`|`) with chomping indicators (`|-`, `|+`, `|`)
- ✅ Folded scalars (`>`) with line folding and chomping

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL BUG:** Plain scalars are space-delimited tokens (breaks multi-word values)
- Implicit typing not implemented (all values are strings)
- Tag directives (`%YAML`, `%TAG`) recognized but not processed

#### Error Reporting (Phase 9.4)
- ✅ Status codes defined and returned
- ✅ Error structure with offset/line/col fields
- ⚠️ Most fields populated in scanner only
- ❌ Context snippets not generated
- ❌ Caret indicators not implemented
- ❌ Error propagation incomplete (stream.c doesn't populate errors)

**Limitations:**
- ~50+ error sites don't populate error details
- Users get status codes but no diagnostic information
- Error messages are generic ("invalid", "limit exceeded")
- No visual error highlighting or caret positioning

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

#### Tag System (Phase 5.1)
Status: Partially implemented

- ✅ Core schema implicit typing (`true`, `null`, `123`, `3.14`)
- ✅ Tag directives (`%YAML`, `%TAG`) and tag handle expansion
- ❌ Standard type tags (`!!timestamp`, `!!set`, `!!omap`, `!!pairs`)
- ❌ Custom tag resolution for application-defined types
- ❌ Binary scalars (`!!binary`)

**Impact:** Core schema typing works, but standard tags and custom tag handling are incomplete.

#### Standard Type Tags (Phase 5.5)
Status: Implemented with limitations

**Current behavior:**
- `!!timestamp` accepts a strict ISO-8601 subset (date or date-time with optional fractional seconds and timezone).
- `!!set` validates mapping values are null; no dedicated set node type.
- `!!omap` and `!!pairs` validate sequence entries are single-pair mappings; `!!omap` enforces unique keys.

**Limitations (implementation-specific):**
- Timestamps are validated but not parsed into a normalized time structure.
- No timezone normalization or conversion to epoch; value remains a string.
- Timestamp parsing only accepts ISO-8601 variants supported by YAML 1.2/1.1.

#### Merge Keys (Phase 5.3)
Status: Not started

- ❌ Merge key (`<<`) parsing
- ❌ Merge semantics implementation
- ❌ Multiple merge sources

**Impact:** Merge keys are not recognized or processed.

#### Advanced Features (Phase 7)
Status: Designed, not started

- ❌ Pull-model parser (optional)
- ❌ Comment preservation
- ❌ Scalar style preservation (round-trip fidelity)
- ❌ YAML → JSON conversion utility
- ❌ Directive handling (`%YAML 1.2`)

**Impact:** Advanced use cases not supported.

#### Spec Compliance Testing (Phase 8)
Status: Not started

- ❌ yaml-test-suite integration
- ❌ Compliance percentage measurement
- ❌ Known deviations documented
- ❌ Fuzzing infrastructure

**Impact:** Unknown spec compliance level. May fail on edge cases.

## Known Bugs

### Critical

None currently identified. Critical memory safety issues and parsing bugs have been resolved.

### High Priority

**1. NULL Pointer Segfault in Error Handling**
- **Issue:** Passing NULL for error parameter causes segfault in some paths
- **Test:** `test-yaml-error-conditions.cpp` - `ErrorHandlingNullPointer` (commented out)
- **Workaround:** Always provide valid error pointer
- **Status:** Needs fix in error handling code

### Medium Priority

**2. Generic Error Messages**
- **Issue:** Error messages lack detail and context
- **Impact:** Difficult to debug parse failures
- **Status:** Documented in Task 9.4, implementation plan ready

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Known Performance Traits

**Good:**
- ✅ Streaming parser is memory-efficient
- ✅ Zero-copy scalar views (pointers into input buffer)
- ✅ Linear time complexity for most inputs

**Unknown:**
- ⚠️ No benchmarks exist (Phase 9.8)
- ⚠️ Parsing speed not measured
- ⚠️ Memory usage not profiled
- ⚠️ Comparison with other parsers not done

**Recommendations:**
- For now, assume moderate performance
- Suitable for configuration files (< 1 MB)
- Not yet optimized for high-throughput scenarios

---

## Compatibility and Standards

### YAML Version Support

- **Target:** YAML 1.2 specification
- **Current:** Partial YAML 1.2 support
  - Core structure parsing works
  - Many 1.2 features not yet implemented
   - YAML 1.1 compatibility mode available (directive or parse option)

### YAML 1.1 Compatibility Notes

When YAML 1.1 compatibility is enabled (via `%YAML 1.1` or `opts.yaml_1_1`),
the resolver expands implicit scalar typing with:

- **Booleans:** `yes/no`, `on/off`, `y/n` (case-insensitive)
- **Octal integers:** leading `0` notation (e.g., `0755`)
- **Sexagesimal numbers:** `190:20:30` or `1:20:30.5`

The compatibility mode only affects **implicit scalar resolution**. Explicit
tags continue to override implicit typing, and the writer remains YAML 1.2 by
default.

### Platform Support

**Tested:**
- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu 22.04, WSL2)
- ✅ MSYS2/MinGW (Windows via POSIX layer)

**Should Work:**
- ⚠️ macOS (not explicitly tested)
- ⚠️ Other Unix-like systems (BSD, etc.)

**Not Supported:**
- ❌ Native Windows (MSVC) - not tested
- ❌ Embedded systems - not tested

## API Stability

### Current API Status

**Streaming Parser API:**
- ⚠️ **Alpha** - Subject to change
- Breaking changes possible before 1.0 release
- Core concepts stable, details may evolve

**Recommended:**
- Suitable for experimentation and prototyping
- Not recommended for production use yet
- Pin to specific commit if using in projects

### Future Breaking Changes

Potential changes before 1.0:
- Error structure may gain fields
- Parse options may add new fields
- Event types may be refined
- Callback signature may change

---

## Migration Path

### From libyaml

**Not Compatible:** This is not a drop-in replacement for libyaml.

Differences:
- Different API design (no pull parser yet)
- Different event structure
- Different error handling
- Different options structure

**Migration Required:** Full rewrite of parsing code.

### From yaml-cpp

**Not Compatible:** This is a C library, yaml-cpp is C++.

Differences:
- Basic DOM implemented but incomplete (62.5% of Phase 4)
- No operator overloading (C API)
- Different memory management
- Plain scalar bug affects multi-word values

**Migration Required:** Full rewrite. DOM API exists but has limitations.

## Using the Module Today

### Recommended Use Cases

**✅ Good For:**
- Learning YAML parsing concepts
- Prototyping YAML-based tools
- Internal tools and scripts
- Configuration file parsing (simple, trusted sources with quoted strings)
- Experimentation with streaming parsers
- Simple DOM-based parsing (single documents, basic structure)

**⚠️ Use With Caution:**
- Production applications (API may change + plain scalar bug)
- Multi-word plain scalars (use quoted strings instead)
- Untrusted input (test thoroughly with your data)
- Complex YAML documents (may hit unimplemented features)
- Multi-document streams (DOM support not yet complete)

**❌ Not Ready For:**
- Mission-critical systems
- Public-facing services parsing user YAML
- YAML with multi-word unquoted values (plain scalar bug)
- Full YAML 1.2 spec compliance required
- Write/serialize capabilities required

### Best Practices for Current Version

1. **Always use security limits:**
   ```c
   GTEXT_YAML_Parse_Options opts = {0};
   opts.max_depth = 32;
   opts.max_total_bytes = 1024 * 1024;
   opts.max_alias_expansion = 10000;
   ```

2. **Test with your actual YAML files:**
   - Parser may fail on features you need
   - Better to discover early than in production

3. **Handle all error codes:**
   ```c
   GTEXT_YAML_Status status = gtext_yaml_stream_feed(parser, data, len);
   if (status != GTEXT_YAML_OK) {
       // Handle error appropriately
   }
   ```

4. **Validate parsed data:**
   - Don't trust structure even if parse succeeds
   - Add application-level validation

5. **Pin your version:**
   - API may change between releases
   - Test thoroughly before upgrading

- Major API changes - need stability first

---

## Conclusion

The YAML module has a **solid foundation** with:
- Working streaming parser (Phase 3 complete)
- Basic DOM parser (Phase 4 ~62.5% complete)
- Comprehensive tests (880+ passing)
- Verified memory safety

However, it's **not production-ready** yet:
- **CRITICAL BUG:** Plain scalars are space-delimited (Task 2.3.6)
- DOM manipulation APIs incomplete
- Writer not implemented
- API may change

**Recommendation:** Use for experimentation, prototyping, and learning. Basic DOM parsing works for simple cases. Wait for plain scalar bug fix (Task 2.3.6) and API stabilization before production use.

**Timeline:** No specific dates for production readiness. Development is ongoing with immediate focus on fixing the plain scalar bug (Task 2.3.6), then completing Phase 4 DOM features.
