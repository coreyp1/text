@page text_examples Examples


This page provides an overview of the example programs included with the Ghoti.io Text library. These examples demonstrate practical usage of the library's APIs and serve as starting points for your own projects.

---

## Overview

The examples are organized by module:

- **JSON Examples** - Demonstrate JSON parsing, writing, streaming, and advanced features
- **CSV Examples** - Demonstrate CSV reading, writing, streaming, and dialect handling
- **YAML Examples** - `yaml_writer_formatting.c` is the program in the tree. The security, streaming and config pages are guides for programs that have not been written

All examples are located in the `examples/` directory and can be built using the Makefile.

---

## JSON Module Examples

The JSON examples are located in `examples/json/` and demonstrate various aspects of the JSON module API.

@subpage example_json_basic

@subpage example_json_create

@subpage example_json_stream

@subpage example_json_file_io

@subpage example_json_pointer

@subpage example_json_patch

@subpage example_json_schema

---

## CSV Module Examples

The CSV examples are located in `examples/csv/` and demonstrate various aspects of the CSV module API.

@subpage example_csv_basic

@subpage example_csv_stream

@subpage example_csv_write

@subpage example_csv_file_io

@subpage example_csv_dialects

@subpage example_csv_headers

@subpage example_csv_irregular_rows

---

## YAML Module Examples

The YAML examples demonstrate the parser and writer APIs.

**Note:** `examples/yaml/` currently holds one program, `yaml_writer_formatting.c`,
which `make examples` builds into `build/<platform>/<config>/apps/examples/yaml/`.
The security, streaming and configuration pages linked below are guides rather
than walkthroughs of files in the tree - the programs they describe have not
been written yet.

For detailed YAML examples, see the [YAML Examples](@ref yaml_examples) page.

## Building Examples

### Using the Makefile (Recommended)

The easiest way to build all examples is using the Makefile:

```bash
# Build the library and all examples
make examples
```

This will compile all examples to `build/linux/release/apps/examples/` (or the appropriate build directory for your platform).

### Running Examples

To run an example (on Linux):

```bash
# JSON example
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build/linux/release/apps \
    build/linux/release/apps/examples/json/json_basic

# CSV example
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build/linux/release/apps \
    build/linux/release/apps/examples/csv/csv_basic
```

On other platforms, adjust the library path as needed for your system.

### Compiling one file

`make examples` is the in-tree build. A compiler line that only adds
`-I include` cannot see cutil, chron or unicode. Against an installed
library:

```bash
cc -o json_basic examples/json/json_basic.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs ghoti.io-text-0)
cc -o csv_basic examples/csv/csv_basic.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs ghoti.io-text-0)
```

---

## Requirements

To build and run the examples, you need:

- **C17-compatible compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **The ghoti.io-text library** built and installed (or available in the build directory)
- **On Linux:** May need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the library location
- **On macOS:** May need to set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the library location
- **On Windows:** The library should be in the system PATH or the same directory as the executable

---

## Getting Started

1. **Start with the basics:** Begin with `json_basic.c` or `csv_basic.c` to understand the fundamental API usage.

2. **Explore your use case:** Choose examples that match what you're trying to accomplish:
   - File I/O? → `json_file_io.c` or `csv_file_io.c`
   - Large data? → `json_stream.c` or `csv_stream.c`
   - Building data? → `json_create.c` or `csv_write.c`
   - Advanced features? → `json_pointer.c`, `json_patch.c`, `json_schema.c`, or `csv_dialects.c`

3. **Read the source:** Each example is well-commented and demonstrates best practices for using the library.

4. **Adapt to your needs:** Use the examples as templates and modify them for your specific requirements.
