 * Shared file I/O helpers, internal to the library.
 *
 * This is a thin mapping onto ghoti.io-cutil's file module. It used to be the
 * implementation as well - a whole-file reader, a temporary-file creator with
 * a `#ifdef _MSC_VER` arm, and a rename wrapper - and src/yaml/yaml_file_io.c
 * carried a second, slightly different copy of the same three things. Reading
 * a file and replacing one atomically are not text-format problems; cutil owns
 * them now for the same reason it owns the allocator, and what is left here is
 * the part that genuinely belongs to this library: turning cutil's result
 * codes into the status each format maps onto its own.

   * quietly narrowed it to 600. PRESERVE keeps whatever the destination

   * The two wrong answers are wrong in opposite directions, and one of them
   * is the one a caller reaches by reflex: PRIVATE is the zero value and
   * narrows a config nobody asked to narrow, while DEFAULT widens one
   * somebody deliberately ran chmod 600 on. Replacing a file is not the same
   * act as creating it.
