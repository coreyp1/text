 *
 * Locale-independent number conversion.
 *
 * See text_number_internal.h for why this is shared rather than per-format,
 * and for the three defects that put it here.
 *
 * ## Why this file no longer touches the locale
 *
 * It used to. Two arms, chosen by a preprocessor guard: uselocale() where a
 * per-thread locale existed, and setlocale() where it did not. The guard was
 * wrong - it tested _POSIX_C_SOURCE above the first #include, and that macro
 * is defined *by* features.h, so it was false everywhere, always. The #elif
 * after it tested __APPLE__ and __FreeBSD__, which are compiler predefines
 * and so *are* live there. The chain therefore selected the good arm on the
 * two platforms nobody builds on and the process-wide arm on Linux.
 *
 * Fixing the guard was the obvious repair and it was not enough, because
 * Windows is a supported target here - the Makefile has /mingw32 and
 * /mingw64 arms with their own install paths - and MinGW has no uselocale.
 * The fallback was not covering some hypothetical platform. It was covering
 * one third of what this library ships to.
 *
 * So the locale is not consulted and not changed. Nothing here calls
 * setlocale, uselocale, newlocale or localeconv, and that is the property to
 * keep: a guard that selects between two arms can select the wrong one, and
 * this file has already proved that it will. No arms, nothing to select.
 *
 * ## What is actually locale-dependent
 *
 * Measured, not assumed, across C, de_DE.UTF-8 (separator ",") and
 * ps_AF.UTF-8 (separator U+066B, two bytes):
 *
 *   - "%lld" and "%llu" are byte-identical in all three. Integer conversion
 *     has no locale-dependent element at all; grouping would need the "'"
 *     flag, which nothing here passes.
 *   - "%.17g", "%.*f" and "%.*e" differ in exactly one place: the decimal
 *     separator. The digits stay ASCII even in a locale with digits of its
 *     own, the exponent marker and its sign do not move.
 *
 * That gives the two halves below their shape.
