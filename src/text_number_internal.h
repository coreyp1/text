 *
 * Locale-independent number conversion, internal to the library.
 *
 * printf and strtod both read LC_NUMERIC, and in a good many locales its
 * decimal separator is a comma. Every format here has to convert numbers
 * without caring what locale the calling program happens to be in: the
 * separator belongs to the format, not to the user's language settings.
 * Three places had gone wrong on their own for want of somewhere shared to
 * put this, and each failed differently.
 *
 *   - A YAML "a: 0.1" came back as the *string* "0.1" rather than a float,
 *     because strtod stopped at a "." the locale did not recognise and the
 *     resolver takes a partial parse to mean "not a number".
 *   - gtext_json_new_number_double(0.1) wrote its lexeme with a bare
 *     snprintf, so the document it went into read "0,1" - not JSON at all.
 *   - A parsed JSON number quietly ended up with no double value, because
 *     the same partial parse left the has-double flag clear.
 *
 * The JSON writer already had the printf half of the answer, twice, behind
 * a portability #ifdef. It lives here now and everything uses it, on the
 * same reasoning as text_file_io_internal.h: keeping it in one place means
 * a fix to it reaches all three formats rather than one.
 *
 * These take a value and a style rather than a printf format string. That is
 * not decoration. The implementation works by repairing the one byte a
 * conversion can spell differently in another locale, and "the output is a
 * number and nothing else" is what makes that repair sound - a format string
 * with literal text in it would break the assumption silently. Taking the
 * value directly means the assumption cannot be violated by a caller.
 *
 * Nothing behind this header calls setlocale, uselocale, newlocale or
 * localeconv; see text_number.c for why the two-armed version that did was
 * the wrong shape for a library that ships to Windows as well as POSIX.
