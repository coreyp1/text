"""Generate the UTS #46 mapping table.

Reads ``third_party/idna/<mapping version>/IdnaMappingTable.txt`` and writes
``src/idna/tables/uts46_tables.c``. Like
gen_tables.py, the output is committed so that a build needs neither the
network nor Python, and ``make check-idna-tables`` regenerates and diffs.

Two data sets with two version pins, because they version on different
schedules: the mapping table is not part of the UCD and lags it. That skew is
harmless here, because the two answer different questions. Only the characters
the mapping table *changes* are taken from it - mapped and ignored - and RFC
5892, derived in gen_tables.py from the UCD, still decides what is valid. A
character the UCD has and the mapping table does not is one the mapping step
leaves alone, which is what an unlisted character means in any case.

Deviations are deliberately absent. Nontransitional processing - which is what
every browser does now and what this library does - leaves all four of them
alone, so an entry saying "change nothing" would be an entry that has to be
read to discover it does nothing.

NFC used to be generated here too, from UnicodeData.txt and
CompositionExclusions.txt. It is ghoti.io-unicode's now - one copy of that data
for the suite instead of one per library - so this generator reads
IdnaMappingTable.txt and nothing from the UCD.

Determinism is a requirement, not a nicety: the check target diffs the
regenerated output against the committed files, so everything is emitted from
sorted input in a fixed format.
