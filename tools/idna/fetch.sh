# Fetch the Unicode Character Database the IDNA tables are derived from.

# The UCD files are not committed: they are large, they are reproducible from
# a version number and a URL, and committing them would make this repository
# the second-best copy of somebody else's data. The *generated* table is
# committed instead, so that a build needs neither the network nor Python.
#
# Only the files RFC 5892's derivation, RFC 5893's bidi rule, UTS #46's mapping
# step and NFC actually read are fetched. That is a short list on purpose: this
# library validates host names, it is not a Unicode library, and a fetch script
# that pulled the whole UCD would invite it to become one.
#
# The version is read from tools/idna/UCD_VERSION, which is the one place it
# is written down. Everything lands in third_party/ucd/<version>/, which
# .gitignore excludes.

#
# UTS #46's mapping table, which versions on its own schedule and is not part
# of the UCD - two data sets, two version files.
#
# **The Consortium publishes it at two different paths and moved between them**,
# which is the whole of why this loops over candidates. `Public/idna/<version>/`
# exists up to 16.0.0 and stops; 17.0.0 lives at `Public/<version>/idna/`. An
# earlier revision of this script knew only the first, and the comment here drew
# the obvious conclusion from the listing it could see: "there is no 17.0.0 of
# it at the time of writing". There is - dated 2025-07-25 - and that false
# premise is what the version pin below has been resting on.
#
# The skew between the two pins is harmless *for the derivation*, because they
# answer different questions: the mapping table is read only for the characters
# it changes - mapped and ignored - and RFC 5892, derived from the UCD above,
# decides what is valid. A character the UCD has and the mapping table does not
# is one the mapping step leaves alone, which is what an unlisted character
# means anyway. Whether to raise IDNA_MAPPING_VERSION to 17.0.0 now that it can
# be fetched is a separate decision with regenerated tables attached to it, and
# is deliberately not made here.
