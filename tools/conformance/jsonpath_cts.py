"""Score this library against the JSONPath Compliance Test Suite.

    tools/conformance/jsonpath_cts.py <suite dir> <runner>

The suite is one file, cts.json, holding 706 cases. Each is either a query that
must be refused (`invalid_selector`) or a query with a document and the node
list it must select - `result`, or `results` where more than one order is
acceptable because the specification leaves object member order to the
implementation.

Three outcomes are counted, not two. A query this library refuses as
*unsupported* - one using match() or search(), which need an I-Regexp engine - is
not attempted, and is reported separately rather than as a pass or a failure. Scoring it as a pass
where the case happens to be an invalid_selector one would count an
unimplemented feature as conformance; scoring it as a failure would bury the
cases that do work.

Environment:
    JPC_MIN         floor on the pass rate over attempted cases (default 100)
    JPC_VERBOSE     print every failing case

What is compared is both the node list - the suite's `result` or `results` - and
the normalized path of each result, its `result_paths`. Comparing only the values
would pass a query that selected the right nodes by the wrong route, and the
paths are what say which route: `$['a'][0]` is not `$['a'][1]` even where the two
hold equal values.
