# Score this library against the JSONPath Compliance Test Suite (RFC 9535).
#
#   tools/conformance/run-jsonpath.sh
#
# The suite is cloned into build/jsonpath-cts on first use and checked out at
# the commit named in tools/conformance/JSONPATH_SUITE_COMMIT, for the reason
# the other four runners pin theirs: a score that moves because somebody
# upstream added a case is not a measurement of this library.
#
# JPC_MIN sets a floor the pass rate must meet, over the cases that were
# attempted. The count that is *not* attempted - the filter selector, which
# this library refuses as unsupported - is printed beside it, because a
# percentage over a subset means nothing without it.
