"""Compare this library's NFC against a pinned CPython's, over everything.

The normalisation is ghoti.io-unicode's, reached through the thin adapter in
src/idna/nfc.c. It can be wrong in ways nothing else here notices: a
composition exclusion missed, the canonical ordering made unstable, the "not
blocked from the starter" test written as a plain comparison - each of those
produces a normaliser that is right about almost every string and wrong about a
few. unicode runs its own, larger oracle against CPython; this one asks the
question through the call path that text actually uses, which is the part a
migration can break.

Two halves, in two places, and which half goes where is forced rather than
chosen:

- **Ours** comes from a C driver linked against the archive, so it runs on the
  host. That is the point of the gate: it exercises `gtext_nfc()`, the buffer
  sizing and the 4x expansion contract, not just the algorithm underneath.
- **The reference** is `unicodedata.normalize` in a CPython pinned by digest in
  tools/oracle/containers/IMAGES, reached through `tools/oracle/nfc_ask.py`.
  It used to be whatever interpreter ran this script, which on this machine is
  two Unicode releases behind the tables being checked - and, less obviously,
  is not even a stable reference at one UCD version: CPython 3.13.5 and 3.13.15
  both report UCD 15.1.0 and answer `unicodedata.decomposition()` differently
  for every Hangul syllable.

What is compared:

- every codepoint on its own, which covers the singleton decompositions and
  every Hangul syllable;
- a starter followed by one combining mark, over every mark with a non-zero
  combining class, which is the composition table;
- a starter followed by two marks, which is where canonical ordering and the
  blocking rule live - an unstable sort or a wrong blocking test shows up here
  and nowhere else;
- the L, V and T jamo in every combination, which is Hangul composition.

**The population comes from the UCD this library pins, never from the
reference.** A mark too new for the reference is still generated, still asked,
and comes back `skip` - counted by name rather than never entering the
population. A harness drawing its subjects from the reference can never ask
about anything the reference does not know; this one asks, gets no answer, and
says so. That is also why EXPECTED below is checked rather than printed: the
population is a fact about the pinned UCD, and a parse that silently dropped
marks would run a smaller comparison and still report no disagreements.

Usage:
    tools/oracle/nfc_diff.py [--ucd DIR] [--version V] [--strict]

`--strict` requires the reference's UCD to equal the pin, which makes `skip`
impossible and a disagreement necessarily a defect. Without it the reference is
allowed to be older, the skipped count is the size of that gap, and a
disagreement is a finding until someone has read it.
