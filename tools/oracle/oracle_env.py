"""How an oracle is spelled, so that no tool here spells one itself.

The pattern is the suite-wide one in `notes/suite/CONTAINERS.md`; `unicode`
landed it first, then `chron`, `font`, `compress` and `regex`. This library is
the sixth and the last with an oracle to take it, and it had two references
living on whatever this machine happened to have installed:

- **CPython's `unicodedata`**, which `check-nfc-oracle` compares NFC against.
  Debian 13 gives UCD 15.1.0 where this library pins 17.0.0, and the gate
  printed the gap rather than closing it. Worth stating precisely, because it
  is the reason the version field below names a UCD and not an interpreter:
  CPython 3.13.5 and 3.13.15 both report `unidata_version == '15.1.0'` and
  disagree about `unicodedata.decomposition()` for all 11,172 Hangul
  syllables. A UCD version is not a sufficient pin. A digest is.

- **`python-idna`**, which `check-idna-oracle` compares the derived IDNA
  property against. Debian 13 packages 3.10, whose *vendored* tables are
  15.1.0, and no interpreter can change them - so this one needs an image
  built here. It is also the pin with the most to gain: 3.19 carries 17.0.0
  exactly, which retires the blind spot that gate used to print.

`command(name)` returns the argv prefix that runs a reference, which is either
this machine's own tool or a `docker run` into an image pinned in
`containers/IMAGES`.

Three properties, in the order they matter:

  1. **It does not fail open.** A missing image, a missing engine, or a version
     that does not match its pin each raises. There is deliberately no "try the
     container, fall back to the host": a gate whose reference is not the one it
     names is worse than one that did not run, because it prints the same green
     line. Host tools have to be asked for by name. This library spent today
     fixing four gates that exited 0 while unable to see, so that rule is not
     abstract here.

  2. **It says which instrument answered.** `provenance()` returns the line
     every gate prints above its numbers. For both references here the *data*
     version is the claim rather than the tool's own release, which is why the
     version field of IMAGES is a UCD and is checked rather than trusted.

  3. **Paths mean the same thing on both sides.** The repository is mounted at
     its own host path, so a path a caller already built resolves unchanged -
     including the pinned UCD under `third_party/`, which both references read.

**Where this library departs from its siblings.** `unicode` relaxes
`check_pin()` in host mode because every image it names is a stock one;
`font` and `compress` assert in both modes because none of theirs is. Like
`regex`, this library has both kinds, so it follows `regex`: host mode reports
rather than asserts, and names the pin it is not. The escape hatch is for a
machine with no container engine, and that is exactly the machine whose
`python3` and `idna` are not the pinned ones.

Modes, from GHOTI_ORACLE_MODE:

  container  (default) run the reference in its pinned image
  host                 run this machine's own tool, and print what it is
