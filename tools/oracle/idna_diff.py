"""Compare the derived IDNA tables against a pinned independent implementation.

The derivation in gen_tables.py is this repository's reading of RFC 5892
section 2. A reading is a thing that can be wrong, and the first one here was:
it looked for Changes_When_NFKC_Casefolded in the wrong UCD file, found an
empty set, and made every upper-case letter PVALID. Nothing about that is
visible in the output unless something else is asked the same question.

That something else is the `idna` package, which implements IDNA2008 from its
own generated tables. It is not a rewording of this code - different author,
different derivation, same RFC - which is what makes the comparison worth
anything. The same package also carries UTS #46's mapping table, so the second
half of this compares that against ours: two readings of one published file, by
different people.

**The reference is pinned, and that is what this gate gained most from.** It
used to be whatever `import idna` found, which on Debian 13 is 3.10, whose
vendored tables are UCD 15.1.0 against these tables' 17.0.0. Because `idna`
carries its own generated data, no interpreter could have changed that - so
unlike the NFC gate, containerising this one is not about reproducibility
first. It is about being able to *choose* the reference: 3.19 is the release
whose tables are 17.0.0, and at a matching version the gate's blind spot has no
members. It used to have 925.

That blind spot is worth stating, because it is the shape this whole file is
arranged around. A codepoint the reference does not assign gets DISALLOWED from
it by default, and this library usually says DISALLOWED too - so for the 925
codepoints that 17.0.0 assigned and 15.1.0 did not, a DISALLOWED of ours that
should have been PVALID agreed with the reference's ignorance and passed.

**At a matched pin that bucket is closed by construction, not by a check, and
the difference matters.** Its size was the gap between two sources of "is this
assigned"; with one source there is no gap to measure, so a zero printed for it
would be a tautology rather than evidence. What the partition prints instead is
the bucket that can still have members and should not: the codepoints the
reference assigns and this library's UCD does not. That is the same failure
mirrored - the reference ahead rather than behind - and it is what pinning idna
3.20, whose tables are 18.0.0, would put in it today.

**Where "is this codepoint assigned" comes from, and why not from the
interpreter.** The obvious source is `unicodedata.category(cp) != "Cn"`, and
that is what this script used to read from whichever CPython ran it. It answers
for the interpreter's UCD release, which is not the release `idna`'s tables were
generated from - the pinned image is `python:3.14-slim` carrying 16.0.0 with
idna 3.19's 17.0.0 installed over it, so asking there would partition the
codespace by a third version that neither side of the comparison uses. Measured
rather than argued: asking the interpreter gives 294,579 codepoints "where both
versions have an opinion" and a blind spot of 4,803, where the right answer at
this pin is 299,382 and 0. The question is asked of the pinned UCD instead,
after asserting that `idnadata`'s version is that same pin.
