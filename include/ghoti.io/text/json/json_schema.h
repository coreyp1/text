 *
 * JSON Schema validation (core subset).
 *
 * This header provides functions for compiling and validating JSON values
 * against JSON Schema documents. This implementation supports a pragmatic
 * core subset of JSON Schema features.
 *
 * The engine enforces a core subset, and **refuses schemas it cannot fully
 * enforce**. A schema using a standard keyword from the list of unsupported
 * keywords below fails to compile with GTEXT_JSON_E_SCHEMA_UNSUPPORTED and
 * the offending keyword named in the error's context_snippet. This is
 * deliberate: silently ignoring an assertion keyword makes invalid data
 * validate clean, which is worse than refusing the schema outright.
 *
 * Genuinely unknown keywords - vendor extensions, and the annotation
 * keywords title, description, default, examples, $comment, readOnly,
 * writeOnly and deprecated - are ignored, as JSON Schema requires. So is a
 * keyword from a vocabulary the schema's dialect does not use: $vocabulary
 * in the metaschema $schema names decides that, and a vocabulary declared
 * required that this engine does not have is refused. So are
 * contentEncoding, contentMediaType and contentSchema, which 2020-12 defines
 * as annotations rather than assertions, and format, which is an annotation
 * unless GTEXT_JSON_Schema_Options::format asks for it to be asserted. So are
 * $schema, $id, $defs, definitions, $anchor and $vocabulary, which cannot
 * change which instances are valid while $ref is unsupported.
 *
 * Callers that genuinely want the old behavior can set
 * allow_unsupported_keywords in GTEXT_JSON_Schema_Options and compile with
 * gtext_json_schema_compile_with_options().
 *
 * Supported schema keywords:
 * - type: null, boolean, object, array, number, integer, string - and arrays
 *   of those. "integer" constrains the value rather than naming a distinct
 *   JSON type, so 5 and 5.0 satisfy it and 5.5 does not.
 * - properties: Object property schemas (recursive validation)
 * - required: List of required property names
 * - items: Array item schema (all items must match)
 * - enum: Array of allowed values (exact match). An empty array is a
 *   schema no instance satisfies, not a schema that asserts nothing
 * - const: Single allowed value (exact match)
 * - minimum/maximum: Numeric constraints
 * - minLength/maxLength: String length constraints
 * - minItems/maxItems: Array size constraints
 * - uniqueItems: Array elements must be pairwise distinct, by structural
 *   equality
 * - exclusiveMinimum/exclusiveMaximum: Strict numeric bounds
 * - multipleOf: Exact divisibility; the divisor must be greater than zero.
 *   Asked in decimal over the digits the document wrote, because that is
 *   the question: 0.0075 is 75 lots of 0.0001, and is not a whole number
 *   of them in the binary either value rounds to. A value whose lexeme was
 *   not kept, or which needs more than 19 significant digits, falls back to
 *   binary remainder
 * - minProperties/maxProperties: Object size constraints
 * - dependentRequired: One property's presence requires others
 * - allOf/anyOf/oneOf/not: Boolean applicators. oneOf is exactly one, so two
 *   matching branches is a failure
 * - if/then/else: "if" selects rather than asserts; an absent branch is no
 *   constraint
 * - $ref, $id, $anchor, $defs and definitions: the reference model is the
 *   specification's, built on URIs. $id establishes a base URI and an
 *   embedded resource; $anchor names a location in one; $ref is a
 *   URI-reference resolved against the base in scope, so "#", "#/...",
 *   "#name", "other.json" and an absolute URI all work. Recursive references
 *   work; targets are compiled once and shared. A reference that leaves the
 *   document is fetched through GTEXT_JSON_Schema_Options::resolver, and
 *   refused at compile time when there is none or it does not know the URI -
 *   except for the nine published 2020-12 meta-schemas, which are embedded, so
 *   that a schema saying "this instance is a valid schema" resolves without a
 *   resolver and without a socket
 * - prefixItems and items, where "items" applies to the elements at an
 *   index past the end of "prefixItems" and to every element when there is
 *   no "prefixItems". draft-07's array-valued "items" compiles to
 *   prefixItems and its "additionalItems" to the same slot "items" fills,
 *   so a schema written either way validates the same. A schema carrying
 *   both "additionalItems" and an "items" that follows "prefixItems" has
 *   named one slot twice, in two drafts that disagree about which wins, and
 *   is refused
 * - contains, minContains, maxContains
 * - additionalProperties, propertyNames
 * - dependentSchemas, and draft-07's "dependencies" in either of its forms
 * - Boolean schemas: "true" accepts everything and "false" nothing, anywhere
 *   a schema is allowed, the root included
 * - $dynamicRef and $dynamicAnchor: a reference whose target is the outermost
 *   schema resource on the validation path that declares an anchor of that
 *   name, which is what lets a schema extend another and have the other's
 *   internal references come back to the extension. A $dynamicRef whose
 *   fragment is not a plain name, or whose target declares no $dynamicAnchor
 *   of that name, is an ordinary $ref
 * - unevaluatedItems and unevaluatedProperties, which apply to whatever the
 *   rest of the same schema object did not reach. What counts as reached is
 *   carried across the in-place applicators - allOf, anyOf, oneOf,
 *   if/then/else, $ref, dependentSchemas - and a subschema that failed
 *   contributes nothing, so an anyOf branch that named half the properties
 *   and then failed has not evaluated them
 *
 * - pattern, patternProperties: only when the caller supplies a
 *   regular-expression provider through GTEXT_JSON_Schema_Options. Without
 *   one they remain in the unsupported list below, because this library has
 *   no regular-expression engine of its own and inventing a half one would
 *   be the silent-mis-validation failure the strict check exists to prevent
 *
 * Unsupported standard keywords (rejected at compile time):
 * - pattern, patternProperties, when no provider was supplied
 * - $recursiveRef and $recursiveAnchor - 2019-09's dynamic-scope references,
 *   which 2020-12 replaced
 * - a $schema naming draft-04 or earlier. Those drafts spell
 *   exclusiveMinimum as a boolean modifying minimum, and $id as id, so
 *   reading one as a later draft gives a wrong answer about the instance
 *   rather than an unknown keyword. 2020-12, 2019-09, draft-07 and draft-06
 *   are read, each with its own keyword set, and the dialect is scoped to the
 *   resource that declares it
 * - regex as a `format`, when format assertion is asked for and no provider
 *   was supplied. It is the only format name this library declines; every
 *   other one in the vocabulary is checked
 *
 * Note on $ref depth: a schema that refers to itself without consuming any
 * instance, such as {"$ref":"#"}, compiles successfully and fails validation
 * with GTEXT_JSON_E_DEPTH rather than recursing without bound.
 *
 * The schema engine is designed to be modular and optional at compile time.

 * are enforced when one is present and refused when it is not.
 *
 * Three obligations, and each is somewhere a validator can quietly get it
 * wrong:
 *
 * - **The dialect is ECMA-262 with the `u` flag.** JSON Schema core section
 *   6.4 says so. A schema author writing `\d` means ECMA-262's `\d`, which
 *   is ASCII, and not Python's or .NET's, which are not.
 * - **The match is a search, not an anchored match.** The pattern need only
 *   match *somewhere* in the string, so a provider that anchors rejects
 *   instances the specification accepts. This is the single most common
 *   mistake in the wild.
 * - **Both strings are UTF-8 and may contain a NUL.** Lengths are given;
 *   neither is terminated for you.
 *
 * `ctx` is passed to every call, so one implementation can serve several
 * independent configurations. Everything reachable from it must outlive every
 * compiled schema that used it: compiled patterns are freed when the schema
 * is, which is after the caller has stopped thinking about the provider.

 * @brief Where a schema from another document comes from

 * being compiled names a schema this library has no way to fetch. Nothing
 * here opens a socket or reads a file: the caller decides what a URI means
 * and hands back the document, which is the only arrangement in which a
 * schema compile cannot become a network request nobody asked for.
 *
 * Without a resolver, a reference that leaves the document is refused at
 * compile time - the same refusal as any other reference that does not
 * resolve, and for the same reason.
 *
 * There is one exception, and it is a set of nine fixed documents rather than
 * a hole in the rule. The 2020-12 meta-schemas - the root at
 * `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema` and the eight under
 * `.../2020-12/meta/` - are embedded in this library, so a schema that says
 * "this instance is a valid schema" resolves with no resolver present. That
 * is not a convenience: the dialect describes itself, so the alternative is a
 * validator that opens a connection during a compile, to a URI it read out of
 * the document it was handed. These URIs also do not version - the reference
 * model rests on each naming one fixed document forever - so an embedded copy
 * cannot fall behind a newer one, which is why the Unicode tables this
 * library derives are treated the other way round.
 *
 * A resolver supplied here is still asked first and still wins, for those
 * URIs as for any other. Serving your own copy - a mirror, a stricter
 * variant - is a thing a caller may legitimately want to do, and a bundled
 * document that could not be overridden would be this library deciding it
 * knows better.
 *
 * The meta-schemas constrain `$id` and `$anchor` with `pattern`, so a `$ref`
 * that reaches them needs `regex` set as well. Without a provider the compile
 * is refused, because reporting a schema as valid on the strength of two
 * constraints that were never checked is worse than declining to answer.
