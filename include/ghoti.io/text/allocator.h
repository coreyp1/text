 *
 * Allocator abstraction for the Ghoti.io Text library.
 *
 * This is cutil's @ref GCU_Allocator under a local name, the same arrangement
 * the compress, image and model libraries use. One definition across the suite
 * means an allocator written for any of them works with all of them, rather
 * than needing a near-identical copy per library.
 *
 * `text` declared its own copy for a while, on the reading that
 * CONVENTIONS.md's "standalone by design" meant no dependency on cutil. That
 * was a misreading: a dependency inside the suite is fine so long as the graph
 * stays a DAG, and cutil is its root. The copy is gone and this is a typedef,
 * so a caller who was already using `GTEXT_Allocator` needs no change.

 * @brief Allocator interface used by the library.

 * All four function pointers must be provided. Each receives the `ctx` pointer
 * from the struct as its first argument, so one implementation can serve many
 * independent pools.
 *
 * Two requirements beyond the C library equivalents, which callers rely on:
 * `calloc_fn` must treat overflow of `nitems * size` as an allocation failure
 * and return NULL rather than allocating a truncated block, and a zero-size
 * request should return a usable non-NULL pointer, so that NULL always means
 * failure.
 *
 * A NULL `GTEXT_Allocator *` anywhere in this library means "use
 * gtext_allocator_default()", so every function taking one may be called
 * without one.
