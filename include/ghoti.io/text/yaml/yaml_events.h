/**
 * @file yaml_events.h
 * @brief Walk a parsed document as a stream of composed node events.
 *
 * This is the *composed* event stream: one event per node of the document
 * tree, in the order the nodes were written, with each node's anchor, tag and
 * style attached to the node they belong to.  It is not the same thing as
 * @ref yaml_stream.h, whose @ref GTEXT_YAML_Event is shaped like the input -
 * indicators, comments, directives, and properties whose node is not yet
 * known.  A consumer that wants to know what the document *is* wants these
 * events; one that wants to know what the input *said* wants those.
 *
 * The walk reports the document as the DOM holds it, which is the document as
 * it was written with two exceptions, both from parse options that are on by
 * default:
 *
 * - Merge keys.  `allow_merge_keys` applies `<<` while the document is being
 *   resolved, so a mapping that used one is walked with the merge already
 *   performed and no `<<` pair in it.  Turn the option off to have the parser
 *   refuse such a document instead.
 * - Aliases are *not* expanded: an alias is its own event, carrying the
 *   anchor name, and the walk never follows it.  A document with a cycle in
 *   it therefore walks in finite time.
