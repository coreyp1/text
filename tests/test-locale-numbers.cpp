/**
 * Numbers do not change meaning with the user's language settings.
 *
 * printf and strtod both read LC_NUMERIC, whose decimal separator is a comma
 * in a good many locales. Three conversions used the bare functions, and each
 * broke differently in such a locale:
 *
 *   - "a: 0.1" in YAML came back as the *string* "0.1". strtod stopped at the
 *     "." it did not recognise, the resolver read the partial parse as "not a
 *     number", and the scalar fell through to string.
 *   - gtext_json_new_number_double(0.1) built its lexeme with snprintf, so
 *     the number went into the document as "0,1" - which is not JSON.
 *   - A parsed JSON number quietly ended up with no double value, from the
 *     same partial parse leaving the has-double flag clear.
 *
 * The separator belongs to the format, not to whoever is running the program.
 *
 * These tests need a locale whose separator is a comma, and a machine may not
 * have one installed - the usual glibc build ships only C, POSIX and en_US.
 * They used to report that and pass, on the reasoning that there was nothing
 * to measure rather than nothing wrong. On this machine there is never one
 * installed, so every one of them skipped, every run, for their whole life -
 * which is how the defect below went unnoticed for as long as it did.
 *
 * So they generate one now, with localedef into a temp directory reached
 * through LOCPATH, needing no root. If that cannot be done,
 * ACommaLocaleIsAvailable *fails*: a machine that cannot produce the hostile
 * condition has not verified anything, and saying so once and loudly beats
 * five quiet passes.
 *
 * There used to be a paragraph here saying that no test in this file could
 * see *which* locale API the library used, because both arms converted
 * correctly and the process-wide one put back what it changed - so the only
 * difference lived in another thread, mid-conversion, and an accessor had to
 * report it structurally.
 *
 * That is no longer true, in both halves. The library now touches no locale
 * at all, so there is no arm to report; and the difference the accessor stood
 * in for is measured directly by AConversionCannotDisturbAnotherThread, which
 * runs a bystander thread and counts how often it sees a separator it did not
 * ask for. Against the old process-wide fallback that count was 4,003,481 in
 * 300,000 conversions. Against what is here now it is 0.

   hypothetical platform, it was covering a third of what this library ships
   to. So the locale is no longer consulted or changed at all, and this test
