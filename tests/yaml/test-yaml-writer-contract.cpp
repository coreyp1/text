/**
 * @file test-yaml-writer-contract.cpp
 * @brief What a writer must never do: claim success and produce something
 *        this library cannot read back.
 *
 * Running yaml-test-suite backwards measures the writers over documents that
 * came from parsing, and that is not the writers' domain.  The DOM API takes
 * any `char *` a caller hands it, so a value the parser would have refused is
 * ordinary on the way out - and a corpus of YAML text can never carry one,
 * because the parser refused it on the way in.  Every defect below was found
 * by building documents rather than by reading them.
 *
 *   - a character 5.1 forbids written raw, so the parser refused the writer's
 *     own output (34 code points);
 *   - an anchor name written without being checked, so "a b" wrote "&a b" and
 *     read back as the anchor "a" with the value shifted into it;
 *   - a tag percent-encoded on the way out but decoded on the way in only
 *     where a %TAG prefix applied, so "%" gained a layer of escaping on every
 *     round trip;
 *   - the streaming writer dropping the %YAML and %TAG directives, leaving a
 *     document whose tag handles were undefined.
 *
 * tests/fuzz/fuzz_yaml_writer.cpp searches the same space without a list.
