/**
 * Where a block collection ends, and where a key is allowed to sit.
 *
 * Two defects are pinned here. A block sequence may sit at the same column as
 * the key that owns it, and one written that way never closed: the parent's
 * next key was taken as another entry, so "a:" over "- 1" over "b: 2" gave
 * {"a": [1, {"b": 2}]} instead of {"a": [1], "b": 2}. And a key indented
 * deeper than its mapping was nested even with no key above waiting for a
 * value, which put a mapping where a key belongs: "a: 1" over an indented
 * "b: 2" gave {"a": 1, {"b": 2}: null} rather than being refused.
 *
 * Expectations are PyYAML's for the same input; the accepted ones are its
 * json.dumps output, which Render() below reproduces exactly.
