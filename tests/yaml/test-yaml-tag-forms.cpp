/**
 * The three spellings of a tag property (5.3).
 *
 * c-ns-tag-property is a verbatim tag, a shorthand, or the non-specific tag:
 *
 *   !<tag:yaml.org,2002:str>   the URI exactly as written, no handle
 *   !!str / !foo               a shorthand, expanded through a handle
 *   !                          the non-specific tag, which is the whole
 *                              property with the node after it
 *
 * Only the shorthand worked. The stream read the token after a "!" as the
 * tag's name whichever form it was, so "! a" used its own node as the tag
 * name and came back as null - three suite cases, including spec example
 * 6.28, where "! 12" is the string "12" beside the integer 12. And the
 * scanner had no idea what "!<...>" was: the brackets are not plain
 * characters and the ":" inside a URI is not a key separator, so
 * "!<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> foo" was read as a plain scalar beginning part
 * way through the URI.
