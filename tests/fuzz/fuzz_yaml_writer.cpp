 * libFuzzer harness for the YAML *writers*.
 *
 * fuzz_yaml.cpp parses and walks and never calls a writer, so until this
 * existed the most productive tool applied to this module had never been
 * pointed at half of it.  Four defects were found by hand that this would
 * have found: a character 5.1 forbids written raw, an anchor name written
 * without being checked, a tag gaining a layer of percent-encoding on every
 * round trip, and the streaming writer dropping the %TAG directive that said
 * what a tag spelling meant.
 *
 * The property is the one all four broke:
 *
 *     if the writer says OK, the bytes it wrote must parse,
 *     and must hold the same values.
 *
 * Two families of input reach the writers here, and they are not the same:
 *
 *   - documents that came from parsing, which is what a round trip over
 *     yaml-test-suite measures; and
 *   - documents built through the DOM API, which is where the interesting
 *     failures were, because a corpus of YAML text can only carry values the
 *     parser accepts.  A DEL never reaches the writer from the first
 *     direction and is ordinary in the second.
 *
 * A harness can only find defects in documents it can *construct*, and that
 * is the bound that has mattered most here.  An hour-long campaign over a
 * merged corpus found nothing, while the two defects before it each needed
 * something the corpus alone could not reach: one needed the DOM API, and the
 * other needed YAML 1.1 mode, which nothing here had ever turned on.  So the
 * axes are drawn from the input rather than fixed:
 *
 *   - the parse options, so 1.1 mode, the three schemas and the key policies
 *     are reachable at all;
 *   - the write options, so indentation, line width, the five scalar styles,
 *     the three flow styles, canonical form and all five *encodings* are -
 *     which puts the writer's UTF-16 and UTF-32 output back through the
 *     reader, an axis yaml-test-suite does not have;
 *   - the node kinds, so !!set, !!omap and !!pairs, typed scalars, stored
 *     scalar styles and comments reach the writer, none of which the three
 *     kinds this built before could express;
 *   - multi-document output, which had no path here at all.
 *

     same applies.  So the value comparison is made where the writer's
     dialect and the reader's agree, and the weaker property - that what the
     writer produced parses - is checked everywhere.  "0755" is the integer 493 in 1.1 and the string "0755" in 1.2,
     and a writer that emits the digits it was given is right both times - so
